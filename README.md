This repository encompasses a series of simulations and control strategies focused on cooperative robotics, emphasizing multi-agent coordination, task prioritization, and motion planning. 
The project encompass:

- **Multi-Robot Coordination:** Implementing algorithms that enable multiple robots to work collaboratively on shared tasks.
- **Task Prioritization:** Developing control architectures that manage multiple objectives with varying importance levels.
- **Motion Planning:** Designing trajectories that ensure efficient and collision-free movements in dynamic environments.
